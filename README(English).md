# 🤖 AI Quant Investment Committee (Multi-Agent System)

An autonomous, **multi-agent collaborative system** for quantitative investment research. Built with **LangGraph** and **Flask**, this project simulates a professional investment committee by deploying specialized AI agents to analyze stock market data and generate comprehensive trading decisions.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

The system is powered by a team of collaborative AI agents (LLMs):

* **📈 Technical Analysis Agent (`tech_agent.py`)**: Analyzes K-line data and moving averages via Baostock.
* **📊 Fundamental Analysis Agent (`fund_agent.py`)**: Audits financial statements (ROE, Net Profit) for growth potential.
* **🌐 Sentiment & News Agent (`sentiment_agent.py`)**: Crawls real-time news and performs targeted web searches for market mood.
* **🛡️ Chief Risk Officer (CRO) Agent (`risk_agent.py`)**: Monitors macro risks and volatility. **Holds veto power.**
* **🏆 Decision Maker (CIO) (`main_workflow.py`)**: Aggregates all reports and hosts a "multi-agent debate" to reach a final verdict.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.
* A **DeepSeek API Key** (Get it from [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/)).

### 2. Obtain the Code

* **For Git Users:** Run the following command in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/ZOES1827/ai-quant-investment-committee.git
cd ai-quant-investment-committee

```


* **For Manual Download:** Click the green **Code** button at the top of this GitHub page, select **Download ZIP**, and extract the files to a local folder.

### 3. Setup and Installation

#### **If you use PyCharm**

1. Open the project folder in PyCharm.
2. Go to `File > Settings > Project > Python Interpreter`.
3. Click `Add Interpreter` and create a new **Virtual Environment** (recommended).
4. Open the **Terminal** tab (usually at the bottom of the screen) and run:
```
pip install flask flask-cors baostock pandas numpy langchain-openai langgraph requests duckduckgo-search urllib3

```



#### **If you use Command Line / Terminal**

Navigate to the project folder and run:

```
pip install flask flask-cors baostock pandas numpy langchain-openai langgraph requests duckduckgo-search urllib3

```

#### **If you use Jupyter / Anaconda**

* You can use Jupyter to test or debug individual agent functions (like `run_tech_agent`).
* To install dependencies in a notebook cell, run: `!pip install flask flask-cors baostock pandas numpy langchain-openai langgraph requests duckduckgo-search urllib3`
* **Note:** To use the web interface, you must still run the Flask server via `app.py`.

### 4. How to Run the System

1. **Start the Backend Service**:
* **In PyCharm**: Right-click `app.py` and select **Run 'app'**.
* **In Terminal**: Run the command `python app.py`.
* Wait until you see the log: `🚀 正在启动多智能体交易 API 服务...`


2. **Open the Frontend UI**:
* Locate the file `智能协作体.html` in your folder.
* **Double-click** it to open it in your web browser (Chrome or Edge recommended).


3. **Perform Analysis**:
* Enter your **DeepSeek API Key**.
* Enter a stock ticker (e.g., `sh.600519` for Kweichow Moutai).
* Click **"开始深度研报"** and wait for the AI committee to finish their deliberation (approx. 15-30s).
