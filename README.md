# 🤖 AI Quant Investment Committee (Multi-Agent System)

An autonomous, **multi-agent collaborative system** for quantitative investment research. Built with **LangGraph** and **Flask**, this project simulates a professional investment committee by deploying specialized AI agents to analyze stock market data from multiple dimensions and generate automated, comprehensive trading decisions.

## 🌟 Key Features

The system is powered by a team of collaborative AI agents (LLMs), each with a specific role:

* **📈 Technical Analysis Agent (`tech_agent.py`)**: Fetches K-line data and moving averages (MA5, MA20) via Baostock to analyze price trends, volume, and momentum.
* **📊 Fundamental Analysis Agent (`fund_agent.py`)**: Audits recent financial statements (ROE, Net Profit Margin) to evaluate the company's profitability and growth potential.
* **🌐 Sentiment & News Agent (`sentiment_agent.py`)**: Crawls real-time macro financial news (Sina, EastMoney, WallStreetCN) and utilizes DuckDuckGo for targeted micro-event searches to gauge market sentiment (Greed vs. Fear).
* **🛡️ Chief Risk Officer (CRO) Agent (`risk_agent.py`)**: Monitors macro system risks (e.g., Shanghai Composite Index) and individual stock volatility. It has the highest priority and can veto any trade to protect capital.
* **🏆 Decision Maker (CIO) (`main_workflow.py`)**: The central node that aggregates reports from all four departments, hosts a "bull vs. bear" debate, and outputs the final trading decision with suggested position sizing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend Framework**: Flask, Flask-CORS
* **AI/LLM Orchestration**: LangChain, LangGraph
* **Data Sources**: Baostock, DuckDuckGo Search, Custom Web Scrapers
* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **LLM Provider**: DeepSeek API (Dynamic key injection)
